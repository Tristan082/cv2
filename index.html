            band For My Pain... and the band of Timo Rautiainen. Holopainen has written several songs that have been
            included in movie soundtracks, including a collaboration with Nightwish bass player and male vocalist
            Marko Hietala on "While Your Lips Are Still Red", for the Finnish film Lieksa! in 2007.
            He also co-wrote the music for Nightwish's own film, Imaginaerum, released in November 2012.
